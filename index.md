### Project 1:
### Lending Club Case Study

 Lending Club (LC) which is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. When the company receives the loan application, it has to make a decision for loan approval based on applicant's profile. This case study is to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default using EDA. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.The main goal of this case study is to analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.
